Give a name to the file such as **hello-world.zx81** and choose a location to save it. It is important to use the **.zx81** extension to avoid conflicts with other extensions you may have installed.

> **Note**: There is no need to create a _launch.json_ file set define a _debug configuration_. The ZX81 Debugger will use a suitable one automatically.

The ZX81 Simulator appears on the right and the debugger stops on the first line of the code with a Z80 instruction.

> **Note**: The file is compiled automatically using a built-in Z80 assembler. There is no need to use an external tool.

To have more space, you can close the Welcome panel.
